# PS Script Boilerplate

## Work In Progress
This repo contains my take on **Photoshop generic Script Boilerplate code** (in *CoffeeScript*), for a project containing a ScriptUI Dialog. It's an early release, which is going to undergo several changes.
I plan to release, alongside the Boilerplate .coffee file, a Demo script that can be used to understand more clearly each Boilerplate's part purpose.

Next, I'd like to extensively use Gist to store ExtendScript/CoffeeScript snippets. Things that I've found, collected and discovered over the years in public Forums, Websites, Documentation, mails from friends and colleagues, etc.

Feel free to contact me if you're willing to contribute!
